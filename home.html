    <p>Covid-19 has impacted people of all nationalities, demographics, and ages
       making it difficult to remain together. Though we must stay physically
       apart, it is imperative that we still stay connectedâ€“as a community and
        as a country. Adopt A Senior gives the unique opportunity for young
        adults and adults alike to reach out to one outside their generation
        and create a bond that will go beyond the pandemic. </p>
    <p>On our sign up page, you may register either yourself or a loved one to
      either be an adopter or adoptee. The role of the adopter is to check in
      on their senior, offer grocery and prescription pick up services, and
       overall be a bright light in a dark time.</p>

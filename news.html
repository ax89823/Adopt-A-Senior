      <h4>Millions of COVID Cases and Deaths Averted Thanks to Lockdowns: One of Humanity's Greatest Achievements</h4>
      <p>
      Despite the novel coronavirus outbreaks delivering countless blows to global economies, two different teams of researchers have published studies praising international and local governments for preventing additional infections and millions of deaths.
      <br>
      <br>
      This week, scientists from Imperial College London and University of California-Berkeley both published studies on the impact of emergency health measures across 17 different countries.
      <br>
      <br>
      Although the teams used different methods of calculation for their research, they both came to similar conclusions: millions of lives have been saved thanks to large-scale interventions during the pandemic.
      <br>
      <br>
      According to the Imperial study, European lockdowns helped to prevent more than 3.1 million deaths. The Berkeley study-which examined infection rates and lockdown measures in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, and the US-found that local and national interventions prevented more than 530 million cases. Both of these studies were published in Nature.</p>

      <h4> New Zealand declares itself 'virus free' as Covid-19 restrictions are lifted </h4>
      <p> New Zealand's lockdown will be lifted from midnight tonight after the prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced there were no known, active cases of coronavirus in the country.
      <br>
      <br>
      In a press conference, Ardern told reporters that there had been no new Covid-19 cases recorded in New Zealand for 17 straight days. The prime minister said she "did a little dance" with her daughter when she found out the virus appeared to have been defeated.
      <br>
      <br>
      The country's borders will stay closed indefinitely to foreign nationals and New Zealanders arriving from overseas will have to spend 14 days in government-run quarantine. Other than that, life in the country of five million will return to normal on Tuesday with social distancing measures dropped completely.
      <br>
      <br>
      In the press conference Ardern praised New Zealanders for their cooperation during the crisis, saying they had "united in unprecedented ways to crush the virus". Ardern herself has been lauded for her handling of the crisis, which saw her "go hard and go early" by placing New Zealand under strict lockdown on 25 March when there were just 200 confirmed cases</p>
